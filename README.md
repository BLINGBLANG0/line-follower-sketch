# Line Follower Sketch 🤖

A basic Arduino-based line follower robot sketch. The project uses IR-based line sensors and motor driver to build a small autonomous robot that can follow a line on the ground.

## 📦 What this Project Is

This repository contains the Arduino sketch code for a simple “line follower” robot — a vehicle that can follow a path marked (for example by black tape on a white surface) by reading IR sensors and adjusting its motors. It’s ideal for beginners or anyone wanting a starting point for robotics experiments.

## 🛠️ Requirements & Components

Typical required hardware:

- Arduino (e.g. Arduino UNO)  
- IR sensor module(s) — line sensors under the chassis  
- DC/geared motors + wheels  
- Motor driver (e.g. L293D or similar)  
- Power source (battery pack)  
- Chassis / frame + basic wiring (wires, connectors, etc.)  

> Note: Exact wiring and hardware setup may vary depending on your sensor & motor driver choice.

## 🚀 Setup & Usage

1. Clone or download the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BLINGBLANG0/line-follower-sketch.git
   ```
Open the sketch file (e.g. .ino) in the Arduino IDE

Connect your hardware: sensors under the robot, motors + driver, power supply

Upload the sketch to your Arduino board

Place your robot on a track (e.g. a white surface with a black tape line)

Power on — robot should follow the line automatically

🎯 How It Works (high-level)

-IR sensors under the robot detect the line beneath (by contrast difference).

-Based on sensor reading (left vs right vs both), the code decides whether to go straight, turn left or right, or stop.

-Motors are controlled through a motor driver to steer the robot accordingly.

-This basic logic is typical of many line-follower projects — enough to get you started.
